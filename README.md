### Objective Of The Project
- <font color=blue>Identify the potential cadidates accurately as much as possible who will join the company.</font>
***

### Importance Of The Project
- <font color=blue>After receiving job offers there is still chance that a potential candidate may join the company or may noy join the company. Now a recruitment process involves time efforts, it requires additinal man-hours who drives the complete recruitmnet process ene-to-end, such a drive needs additional cost, planning etc. So, once releasing an offer letter to a candidate it means the company has a or yet-to-filled vanacncy for that position. They have planned to fillup that position with a potential candidate who they finally released the offers. Now if the candidate roll back from that offer at that time it will be a loss for that company in terms of many things like time, effort, operational cost, loss to the projcets for which they planned to recruit for, it may hamper project planning, project budgeting etc as well. Hence, it is important for an org to predict who is a potential candidate and who is not.</font>

### Technical Aspect
#### The project is divided into major 6 parts:
- <font color=blue>Data Quality Check or inspection of the data.</font>
- <font color=blue>Descriptive statitics or summary statistics.</font>
- <font color=blue>Exploratory Data Analysis.</font>
- <font color=blue>Data Pre-processing.</font>
- <font color=blue>Model Building.</font>
- <font color=blue>Model Evaluation.</font>
- <font color=blue>Conclusion.</font>

### About The Dataset
- <font color=blue>HRWorks IT workforce recruitment data that includes IT companies in India to recruit IT professionals. Based on the given features we need to predict the chance of a candidate joining the company.</font>
***

### Target Feature
- <font color=blue>Status = 'Joined' (cosidering as the positive class, 1)</font>
- <font color=blue>Status = 'Not Joined' (cosidering as the negative class, 0)</font>
